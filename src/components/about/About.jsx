                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Having tried my hand at marketing, events, and even acting, I finally found an industry that spoke to my love of continuous learning when I landed a position in tech sales. I quickly found myself poking around the developers' space, and when curiosity got the best of me I dove into programming head-first.</p>
                    <p>Jan - May 2021 I studied introductory data analysis at the University of Pennsylvania, and in October I will graduate from Eleven Fifty Academy's software development immersive bootcamp with experience writing <a href="#portfolio">full-stack .NET applications</a>.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not studying and writing code, I love to travel with my husband, Michael, and our mini Aussie puppy, FÃ©lix. I enjoy charcoal sketching and (much to my husband's dismay) home renovation in my spare time.</p>
